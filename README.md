# blog_recommendation_system 


my try at creating webapp utilizing recommendation engine. As a content I planned to use various blogs and internet magazines. As of yet, application is not finished, but I hope to change it soon. It is also terribly ugly since I am in no way accustomed to writing CSS tags. 

by "not finished" I mean working, but certainly not polished. There is long way ahead before I achieve that noble goal. 

I am still learning Django's ways, so should you spot non-optimal solution ( and there is surely abundance of them ), feel free to drop me a line what's wrong.
